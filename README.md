# Create the release build

- Make sure that `gradle.properties` file is kept under the `.gradle` directory. In Windows, `.gradle` directory is under `C:\Users\<username>`.
- Increment `version` in `package.json`.
- Increment `versionMajor` or `versionMinor` or `versionPatch` in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Create the apk build.

```
yarn run android-build-apk
```

- Uninstall the app from device (from work profile as well if available). Connect the device using USB.
- Install the apk file onto device

```
adb -s <device_name> install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

- Complete the sanity testing and capture the screenshots.
- Update the screenshots in this README.
- Capture the home screen screenshot on emulator with Nexus_7_API_33.
- Capture the home screen screenshot on emulator with Nexus_10_API_33.
